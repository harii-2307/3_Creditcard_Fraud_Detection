# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression

This project implements a credit card fraud detection system using Logistic Regression. The model is trained on a dataset containing credit card transactions to identify patterns associated with fraudulent activities.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a credit card transaction dataset (`creditcard.csv`). It includes information about normal and fraudulent transactions, making it suitable for fraud detection analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

- Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
- Explored the first and last 5 rows of the dataset.
- Checked dataset information for data types and non-null values.
- Examined the number of missing values in each column.
- Analyzed the distribution of legit and fraudulent transactions.

## Data Preprocessing

- Handled the highly unbalanced nature of the dataset.
- Extracted statistical measures for legit and fraudulent transactions.
- Split the data into features (X) and target variable (Y).
- Divided the data into training and testing sets.

## Model Training

- Implemented Logistic Regression for model training.
- Assessed the accuracy on both the training and testing datasets.

## Model Evaluation

- Evaluated the model's accuracy on both the training and testing datasets.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
